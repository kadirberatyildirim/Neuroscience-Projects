 
In the Posner paradigm, research participants are asked to fixate in the center of the
screen and not to break fixation for the duration of the trial. Then, a location on the screen
is cued in some way (usually by highlighting or flashing something). After the cue, a tar-
get appears in either the cued location or in another location. Research participants are
instructed to press a key as soon as they see the target.

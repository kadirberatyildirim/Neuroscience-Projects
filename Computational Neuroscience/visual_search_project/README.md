 
So what is the visual search and pop-out paradigm that was used in the Treisman
study?

Research participants were asked to report the presence or absence of a target stimulus
(in this case, a colored lowercase letter “o”) among various numbers of distracter stimuli. If
the distracter stimuli are just of a different color—that is, if they differ by a single feature—
you usually find the “pop-out” effect: the reaction time to detect the target is independent
of the number of distracters. Conversely, if more than one stimulus dimension has to be
considered to distinguish targets and distracters (conjunction search), you typically find a
linear relationship between reaction time and the number of distracters.

PCA will be used to classify neurons in the unsorted spike data.
- The first thing we could do (before pca) is taking windows of amplitude.
- For a given ml algorithm, we could use as many features as there are data points.
So 15 data points, we could have 15 dimensionality, but would not be interesting and would take too much time.
For example take a robotic arm, where we get signal from brain in real time and we need to classify neurons in real time
then computing power is important, as well as how hard it is to compute. So we want to reduce the dimension with pca.
